# About Protein App (WWDC Swift Student Challenge 2023 Submission)

About Protein was created to help individuals maintain a healthy diet. Our app features a daily protein needs calculator based on international standards that aids users in meeting their nutritional requirements. By entering their weight, users can determine their daily protein intake recommendations, which are critical for maintaining muscle mass, repairing tissues, and producing hormones and enzymes. Along with the calculator, our app offers a "Play Together" feature, where users can explore the effects of protein deficiency or excess in a fun, interactive way. We aim to make nutrition education enjoyable and engaging to encourage more people to understand the importance of proper nutrition. Our app is designed to be accessible and engaging for all users, with simple animations, music, and easy-to-understand messages. We used Swift UI, AV Foundation, and UI Kit to develop a seamless user experience. The app's color scheme and fonts are also customized using hard code, making it visually appealing and user-friendly.
